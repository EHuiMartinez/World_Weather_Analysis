# World_Weather_Analysis
This analysis on world weather for travel destinations using API calls to retrieve relevant data.

##Potential Use Case
Input fields can be created to allow travelers to enter weather preferences to filter retrieved data.  Based on the preferences, potential travel destinations and nearby hotels can be suggested.  From this list of potential travel destinations, the traveler can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.  Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities can be created for the traveler.  

##Technical Deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Weather_Database
